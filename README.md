# Open Optical Ray Tracer
openORT (or OORT, in reference to Jan Oort, a Dutch astronomer after which the Oort cloud is named) is a free-to-use, open source optical design software intended to democratise the field of optical engineering. OORT is aimed at students, amatuer astronomers, and people who are fascinated by the world of optics but do not have the means to pursue a graduate degree or pay exorbitant prices for industry standard software such as Zemax OpticStudio, CODE V, or OSLO. These will undoubtedly provide richer feature sets, but their learning curves are steep and their UIs unintuitive. OORT provides a friendly environment in which to learn the principles of optical design and hopefully bring its concepts down to eye level while not sacrificing accuracy.
